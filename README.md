Meta is one of my favorite companies.


This is my personal learning notes on its public software development course in my spare time, including frontend side and backend side,

which really made me recall the time when I first came into contact with software engineering in my undergraduate studies. 

Share it here, hope you can enjoy it tooÔºÅ
